 Use the buttons below to import files to be used in the script of choice. 
 The imported file is displayed below and  if more than one is imported you can select
 active file, important for some scripts. The original files are not affected. 
 
 Each script works a little differently. Some produce data that can be saved to
 a new file, others produce graphs that can be saved as images.  Check the script 
 description for details.
